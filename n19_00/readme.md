Christmas game. It was started in GameMaker Studio. Redoing in Godot.  

## Navigation
The player navigation uses AStar in GMS (mp_grid).  
Tested polygon navigation in Godot (Navigation2D node). Generated path is not as expected. Dificult to define colisions in map.  
The best result was obtained with AStar2D node.
